# portfoilo
My first attempt at my portfolio.
Tried to create a simple portfolio while also adding some style so it wouldn't be bland.
Created buttons on my header and footer that direct you to other points of my website and other links that I have.
Added photos and sections as placeholders when I have stuff to add in those sections, as well as added contact buttons like twitter, youtube, linktree, etc.
Used CSS for styling and coloring as well as positioning.
